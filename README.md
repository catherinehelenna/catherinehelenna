- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on explorative data analysis techniques, involving:
    - [x] data preprocessing: perform data extraction through web scrapping, then clean and normalize data.
    - [x] data analysis: convert and transform data to extract meaningful insights and confirm results by running statistical methods.
    - [x] data visualization: display my findings into easy-to-understand diagrams.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more data science tools such as machine learning algorithms and big data analytics.
- âš¡ Fun facts: I used to do chemistry stuffs in laboratories during bachelors where my interest in data has grown significantly ever since. I really like to learn new things; I just cannot stop digging into things once I start it. I love doggies and yoga.
