## Hi, I'm Catherine Helenna!ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about unraveling hidden stories in data to craft impactful solutions and drive meaningful decisions.ðŸ“Šâœ¨
</div>

- ðŸ’¡ I have become more proficient in explorative data analysis techniques (data preprocessing, data analysis with statistical methods, and data visualizations). So feel free to check my visualization projects about Airbnb and Value-Buy Smartphones.

- ðŸš€ I have made a predictive study with machine learning algorithms and designed an automation data processing workflow with NoSQL database systems, showcased in the repositories titled Predict Purchase Behaviors and Workflow Coffee Bean Analysis.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in gaining more experiences with Deep Learning applications and exploring big data analytics tools. Hence, I am planning to make more projects to demonstrate my learning outputs. So, stay tuned!

- âš¡ Fun facts: I used to do chemistry stuffs in laboratories during bachelors where my interest in data has grown significantly ever since. I really like to learn new things; I just cannot stop digging into things once I start it. I love non-fictions, (cooking) reality shows, doggies, and yoga.
